<p>Yeah. Roadie for <b>Metallica</b>, <em>Speed of Sound Tour</em>. Show me what you got. Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman. Sure. That and a pair of testicles. You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday. Wonderful woman. Very free-spirited. We're all very fond of her. Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Jackie Treehorn treats objects like women, Man...</li>
	<li>Who'm I? I'm a fucking <strong>VETERAN!</strong></li>
	<li>Near the In-and-Out Burger.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything! What the fuck were you talking about?!</li>
	<li>As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe.</li>
	<li>It's a fucking show dog with fucking papers. You can't board it. It gets upset, its hair falls out. </li>
</ol>

<p> He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique <mark>position</mark> to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion. Yeah man. Well, you know, the Dude abides. Can we just rent it from you? All right, Plan B. You might want to watch out the front window there, Larry. And let's also not forget-let's not forget, Dude that keeping wildlife, an <i>amphibious rodent</i>, for domestic, you know, within the city that isn't legal either.</p>

<blockquote>I'm talkin' about the <acronym>Dude</acronym> here -sometimes there's a man who, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there-and that's the Dude, in Los Angeles...and even if he's a lazy man, and the Dude was certainly that-quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County. Say friend, ya got any more a that good sarsaparilla? Wal, I lost m'chain of thought here. But-aw hell, I done innerduced him enough.</blockquote>

<p>Saturday is shabbos. Jewish day of rest. Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll! The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software. Wave of the future, Dude. 100% electronic. Well, I still jerk off manually. I don't like your jerk-off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk-off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk-off. Leads? <strike>Yeah</strike>. I'll just check with the boys down at the Crime Lab. They've assigned four more detectives to the case, got us working in shifts. It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs, lotta what-have-yous.</p>
